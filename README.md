## 📌 About the Project
This is a Shopping List application developed to practice and apply the fundamentals of React. It's a simple yet powerful app where users can:

- 🛍 Create a shopping list
- ➕ Add, 🗑 Delete, and ✏️ Update items
- ❌ Clear all items
- 📊 View a summary of total items and completed items

## ✨ Features
✅ **Item Management**: Add, update, delete, and clear items in the list  
✅ **State Management**: Utilizes `useState` for local state and a global state to track items  
✅ **Summary Calculation**: Displays total items and how many are checked off  
✅ **CSS Styling**: Designed with Flexbox for a modern and responsive UI  

## 📚 What I Learned
This is my first React project, and it gave me hands-on experience with core React concepts, including:

- 🏗 **State Management** using `useState`
- 🎭 **Conditional Rendering** to dynamically display UI elements
- ✍ **Event Handling** to manage user interactions
- 📋 **Form Handling** for adding new items
- 🌍 **Global State Usage** for shared data across components
- 🎨 **CSS Flexbox** for a visually appealing layout
